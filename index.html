               I was born in Cuba in to an awesome, baseball loving family. I moved to the US in 1995 and through much culture shock began to integrate myself into the US. I have moved a number of times during my life but no matter the country or situation I have always loved technology. I have geeked out on devices from the Atari that my uncle helped me fix in Cuba to the surface I like to work on now. I now work as a Financial Systems manager for a food chemicals company and I am looking to expand my skillset. I believe that the full stack course will allow me to do a lot more than I am able to do now. I want to use this experience to learn about basic scripting but eventually get to predictive data analytics. I am mostly using this text to see if I can get this stupid paragraph to wrap :)
